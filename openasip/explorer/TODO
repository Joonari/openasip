General/Explorer:
- After writing adf/idf to the dsdb, delete them. Explorer is leaking memory
  quite efficiently now :)

- how to preserve frequency an max area limitations when selecting components
  when other plugins are called.

- c2vhdl script should print information about estimates. 
    [waiting for a new HDB with more estimation related data] 

- c2vhdl script should accept multiple programs as parameters.

- Check that every plugins parameters that are truly needed are compulsory
  params.

- explore -v -g should print plugin loading dir as well.

- All plugins compulsory parameters are not checked! Add checkParameter() to
  the plugins.

- Fix printing error messages in Explorer, all error messages to stderr by
  default.

Evaluate:
- systemtest after the new HDB is done.

MinimalOpSet:
- Rename plugin when adding more functionality like guard register checker.
  MinimalResourceAdder might be a good name.

ComponentAdder:
- ComponentAdder plugin is rather limited now.

SimpleICOptimizer:
- Check that SimpleICOptimizer works right with large programs (doesn't remove
  needed read/write port from GCU) 
- Add parameter flag for guard register preservation or make the preservation
  always default.


Documentation:
- write a tutorial for the minimize machine plugin.
- update the documentation for the plugins.
- state clearly what is needed in application dir for specific plugin.


Tests:
- add estimation to the DesignSpaceExplorerTest.hh after estimation is
  optimized.
- fix frequency sweep plugin long systemtest.
- simple FrequencySweepExplorer long system test
- (FrequencySweepExplorer) create a (long) systemtest with at least 3 
  applications with realistic realtime requirements, explore and verify the
  result, this is prob going to be too long test to run rutinely.
    [FrequencySweeper plugin testcases need a new HDB]
- tests for plugings that use more than one application.


Refactor/cleanups:
- make longest path selection of units in implementation selector module a
  function.
- LLVMBackend.hh compile/schedule functions to use const machine.
