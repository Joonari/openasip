about automatic selection of SQRTF
----------------------------------

TCE 1.2 with LLVM 2.7 (and probably some earlier TCE versions) can 
use SQRTF operation automatically when the target supports it 
and math.h sqrtf() is called. 

C99 standard says:

1 The behavior of each of the functions in <math.h> is specifed for 
  all representable values of its input arguments, except where stated 
  otherwise. Each function shall execute as if it were a single operation 
  without generating any externally visible exceptional conditions.

2 For all functions, a domain error occurs if an input argument is 
  outside the domain over which the mathematical function is defined. 
  The description of each function lists any required domain errors; 
  an implementation may define additional domain errors, provided
  that such errors are consistent with the mathematical 
  definition of the function.  On a domain error, the function returns 
  an implementation-defined value; 

  if the integer expression math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO is nonzero, 
  the integer expression errno acquires the value EDOM; if the integer 
  expression math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT is nonzero, the invalid
  floating-point exception is raised.

Thus, it's not mandatory to update the errno in sqrtf() which the
hardware operation does not. We just have to make sure 
'math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO' is zero. Similarly, as we do not support
exceptions, 'math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT' should be zero aswell.

On the other hand, it seems from this sentence that the standard requires 
exceptions (from F.9 point 4):

  The expression math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT shall evaluate to a
  nonzero value.

This part seems to imply that one should define at least one of MATH_ERRNO or
MATH_ERREXCEPT-based error handling:


  The macros

       MATH_ERRNO
       MATH_ERREXCEPT

  expand to the integer constants 1 and 2, respectively; the macro
  math_errhandling expands to an expression that has type int and 
  the value MATH_ERRNO, MATH_ERREXCEPT, or the bitwise OR of both. 
  The value of math_errhandling is constant for the duration of the 
  program. It is unspecified whether math_errhandling is a macro or 
  an identifier with external linkage. If a macro definition is 
  suppressed or a program defines an identifier with the name
  math_errhandling, the behavior is undefined.

  If the expression math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT can be nonzero, 
  the implementation shall define the macros FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_INVALID, 
  and FE_OVERFLOW in <fenv.h>.

My (Pekka J. 2010-05-24) current conclusion of this is that 
selecting SQRTF automatically as a replacement to a sqrtf() call
is not safe as the programmer might not realize that it does not 
support error handling of any kind. He might have code written that
assumes errno is updated.
