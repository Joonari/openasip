Support for 64b machines with 64b integer and pointer arithmetics is
at experimental stage.

A starting point machine for 64b designs can be found
in data/mach/minimal_64b_with_stdout.adf.

Known missing features:

- floating point emulation breaks with 64b machines
- double precision float support not finished
- ProDe cannot set the 64 bitness attribute, ADF needs to
  be edited by hand
- overall stabilization
