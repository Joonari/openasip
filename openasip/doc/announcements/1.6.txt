TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) v1.6 released
---------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) is a toolset for designing 
application-specific processors based on the Transport Triggered 
Architecture (TTA). The toolset provides a complete retargetable co-design
flow from high-level language programs down to synthesizable processor
RTL (VHDL and Verilog backends supported) and parallel program binaries.
Processor customization points include the register files, function units, 
supported operations, and the interconnection network.

This release adds support for LLVM 3.1, experimental Verilog backend
for the Processor Generator, support for explicit access to multiple
address spaces from C, a simplified C++ interface for accessing the
simulation engine, automated generation of clustered-style TTA
machines, experimental vector input and a bottom-up instruction
scheduler. See the CHANGES file for a more thorough change listing.
