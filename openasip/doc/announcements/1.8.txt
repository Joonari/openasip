TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) v1.8 released
---------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) is a toolset for designing 
customized processors based on the Transport Triggered Architecture 
(TTA). The toolset provides a complete retargetable co-design
flow from high-level language programs down to synthesizable processor
RTL (VHDL and Verilog backends supported) and instruction-level parallel 
program binaries. Processor customization points include the register files, 
function units, supported operations, and the datapath interconnection 
network.

This release adds support for LLVM 3.3, improved LLVM-side if-conversion,
initial operand sharing implementation, native support for half
precision floats, several usability improvements to the Processor
Designer GUI, bug fixes and more.

Note 1: This time we decided not to package release tar balls. The users 
are directed to check out the release branch from the version control 
system. The branch might get fixes backported after the release
announcement.

Note 2: LLVM 3.3 has a bug which might cause miscompilation when multiple
address spaces are used. You need to apply a fix for it to the LLVM before TCE
configure accepts it. See the INSTALL file for details.
