TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) v1.7 released
---------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) is a toolset for designing 
application-specific processors based on the Transport Triggered 
Architecture (TTA). The toolset provides a complete retargetable co-design
flow from high-level language programs down to synthesizable processor
RTL (VHDL and Verilog backends supported) and parallel program binaries.
Processor customization points include the register files, function units, 
supported operations, and the interconnection network.

This release adds support for LLVM 3.2, initial support for
half-precision floats, improved vector support and OpenCL
host-tta-device mode simulation with pocl's ttasim driver. See the
CHANGES file for a more thorough change listing.
