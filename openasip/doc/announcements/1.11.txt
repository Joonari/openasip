TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) v1.11 released
----------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) is a toolset for designing 
application-specific processors based on the Transport Triggered 
Architecture (TTA). The toolset provides a complete retargetable co-design
flow from high-level language programs down to synthesizable processor
RTL (VHDL and Verilog generation supported) and parallel program binaries.
Processor customization points include the register files, function units, 
supported operations, and the interconnection network.

This release adds support for LLVM 3.6, adds address of label extension
support, brings various usability improvements and fixes several bugs 
among other improvements (see CHANGES document and 'bzr log' for details).

Note: This time we decided it is not useful to do a "tar ball release". 
Users are directed to check out the release branch from the version 
control system. The branch might get fixes backported also after 
the release announcement.
