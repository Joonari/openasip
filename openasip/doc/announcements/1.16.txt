TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) v1.16 released
----------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE) is a toolset for design and
programming of low power customized processors based on the Transport
Triggered Architecture (TTA). The toolset provides a complete retargetable
co-design flow from high-level language programs down to synthesizable
processor RTL (VHDL and Verilog generation supported) and parallel program
binaries. Processor customization points include the register files,
function units, supported operations, and the interconnection network.

Release Highlights
==================
- Support for LLVM 5.0.
- Support for little-endian TTAs.
- VLIWConnectIC: An explorer plugin which creates a VLIW-like interconnection
  network and creates a separate RF for each distinct bus width.
