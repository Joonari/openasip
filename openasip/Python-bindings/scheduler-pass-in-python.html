<h1>Writing a TCE scheduler pass in Python</h1>

The TCE schefuler front end has support for passes written in Python. If
the name of the file in a scheduler configuration file ends with
<i>.py</i>, the scheduler front end runs the pass using a Python
interprepter embedded in the scheduler.
<p>
Ideally, the passes written in Python should be completely isolated
from each other. Unfortunately this does not seem to be possible with
current Python and current Boost.Python (i.e. Python 2.5 and Boost
1.33.1). The Python C API has a promising
function <tt>Py_Finalize()</tt>, which, according to its documentation,
releases all resources held by the Python interpreter. This is not
quite true, though, and repeated sequences
of <tt>Py_Initialize()</tt> ... <tt>Py_Finalize()</tt> leak
memory. Boost.Python also does not work nicely
with <tt>Py_Initialize()</tt>.
<p>
In the current design, the Python interpreter is initialized exactly
once when it is first needed, and <tt>Py_Finalize()</tt> is not
called at all. Thus, the resources held by the Python interpreter are not
released while the scheduler is running.

<p>
The main effect this has on writing scheduler passes in Python is that
all the passes share the same name space, and all the global state left
behind by one pass is there when the next one starts. This should not
really matter unless perhaps if you do serious metaprogramming in Python.

<h2>Interface</h2>

The scheduler frontend communicates with a pass written in Python
using the following interface. 
<p>
The name of the Python class implementing the pass is derived from the
name of the Python source file. If the pass is in
file <tt>MyCleverPass.py</tt>, the frontend attempts to instantiate an
object of class <tt>MyCleverPass</tt>. 
<p>
The class implementing a scheduler pass should implement the
following methods.
<ul>
<li><tt>__init__(<i>self</i>)</tt>
<p>Constructor, should do nothing. 
</li>
<li><tt>needsTarget(<i>self</i>)</tt>
<p>Return true/false depending on whether the pass needs the target or not.
</li>
<li><tt>needsProgram(<i>self</i>)</tt>
<p>Return true/false depending on whether the pass needs the program (POM) or not.
</li>
<li><tt>needsProgramRepresentation(<i>self</i>)</tt>
<p>Return true/false depending on whether the pass needs the program
  in another representation. This is redundant for now, as the
  scheduler front end only passes the program in POM.
</li>
<li><tt>setTarget(<i>self, target</i>)</tt>
<p>This method is called by the scheduler front end
  if <tt>needsTarget()</tt> returned true. The parameter <i>target</i>
  is a <tt>TTAMachine::Machine</tt> object wrapped so that it can be
  used from Python. The method should store it somewhere for later
  use, for example assign it to <tt>self.target</tt>.
</li>
<li><tt>setProgram(<i>self, program</i>)</tt>
<p>This method is called by the scheduler front end
  if <tt>needsProgram()</tt> returned true. The parameter <i>program</i>
  is a <tt>TTAProgram::Program</tt> object wrapped so that it can be
  used from Python. The method should store it somewhere for later
  use, for example assign it to <tt>self.program</tt>.
</li>
<li><tt>start(<i>self</i>)</tt>
<p>This method is called by the scheduler front end to start the
  actual pass.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

For example, if you want to run the pass <i>NoOpPass</i>, written in Python,
the scheduler configuration file would contain the following:
<p>
<pre>
&lt;scheduler-configuration&gt;
	&lt;pass&gt;
		&lt;module&gt;
			&lt;name&gt;NoOpPass&lt;/name&gt;
			&lt;file&gt;NoOpPass.py&lt;/file&gt;
		&lt;/module&gt;
	&lt;/pass&gt;
&lt;/scheduler-configuration&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The scheduler front end would then load <tt>NoOpPass.py</tt>, and
create an instance of the Python class <tt>NoOpPass</tt>. An example
implementation of the class is given below.
<p>

<pre>
#
# A scheduler pass that does nothing.
#

import TTAMachine
import TTAProgram

#
# This class will be instantiated by the scheduler frontend.
#

class NoOpPass:
    def __init__(self):
        print "NoOpPass instantiated"

    def needsTarget(self):
        print "needsTarget() called"
        return True

    def needsProgram(self):
        print "needsProgram() called"
        return True

    def needsProgramRepresentation(self):
        print "needsProgramRepresentation() called"
        return False

    def setTarget(self, target):
        print "setTarget() called with", target
        self.target = target

    def setProgram(self, program):
        print "setProgram() called with", program
        self.program = program

    def start(self):
        print "Running NoOpPass.py"
