<h1>README file for the TCE Python bindings</h1>

This directory contains the Python bindings for TCE libraries.

<h2>Background</h2>

The bindings use the <a
href="http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html">Boost.Python</a>
library for exposing C++ classes to Python. The library makes it
possible to manipulate objects created by C++ libraries as if they
were Python objects.


<h2>Loadable Python modules</h2>

Boost.Python produces shared objects that the Python interpreter can
load as if they were regular Python modules. Once loaded with
<tt>import</tt>, the C++ classes and functions in a module are visible
as Python classes and functions. For example:

<pre>
    $ python2.4
    Python 2.4.4c1 (#2, Oct 11 2006, 21:51:02) 
    [GCC 4.1.2 20060928 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.1-13ubuntu5)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import TTAMachine
    >>> b = TTAMachine.Bus("b1", 32, 16, TTAMachine.Machine.Extension.ZERO)
    >>> b
    &lt;TTAMachine.Bus object at 0xb7da2a54>
    >>> m = TTAMachine.Machine()
    >>> m
    &lt;TTAMachine.Machine object at 0xb7da2a7c>
    >>> m.addBus(b)
</pre>

You need to set PYTHONPATH to include the directory where the loadable
modules are, and you also need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately so
that the TCE libraries referenced by the bindings can be found. The
Python modules only provide the glue between C++ and Python.

<h2>Scheduler Passes in Python</h2>

See <a href="scheduler-pass-in-python.html">a separate document</a>
for information on how to write scheduler passes in Python.


<h2>Adding new bindings</h2>

Adding new classes is relatively easy, and adding new methods in
existing classes is even easier.  The <a
href="http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/index.html">
Boost.Python tutorial</a> gives a pretty clear idea what to do, and it
is relatively safe just to copy and paste from the existing ones.
The cases to be aware of are:
<ul>
  <li>function that returns a raw pointer, and
  <li>function that takes a raw pointer <i>and retains ownership of
  the pointer.</i>
</ul>

Both of these have to do with how C++ and Python manage objects. 
<p>

When a C++ function returns a pointer, Boost.Python needs to know
whether it should take care of the pointer or not.  This is something
that cannot be inferred from a function signature, so it needs to be
explicitly stated by the programmer using a <i>call policy</i>, <a
href="http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/python/functions.html#python.call_policies">
as explained in the tutorial</a>. The two more common policies are
<tt>return_internal_reference</tt> and
<tt>return_value_policy&lt;manage_new_object&gt;</tt>.

<p>
If a C++ function (e.g. a member function) is passed a raw pointer,
and the function takes ownership of the pointer, Python needs to be
informed about the ownership transfer. This can be done using an
<tt>auto_ptr</tt>, see the
<a
href="http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/v2/faq.html#ownership">Boost.Python
FAQ</a>
for details.
