Defines a set of operations that can be used to emulate file I/O to
allow compiling certain benchmarks which require input and output
to be performed through a file system.

The operations can be used to implement the syscalls 
open(), write(), read(), and lseek(). See file_io_emu.c for
implementations.

TODO: 
- make it possible to compile frontend which uses extern open()/write()/etc.
  and link an object that defines the previous functions 
  - a define CUSTOM_FILE_IO_FUNCTIONS or something
