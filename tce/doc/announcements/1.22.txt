OpenASIP v1.22 Released
-----------------------

OpenASIP, also known as TTA-based Co-Design Environment (TCE), is an open
source application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) toolset for
design and programming of customized co-processors (compiler-programmable
accelerators). It is based on the static energy efficient Transport Triggered
Architecture (TTA) processor template.

The toolset provides a complete retargetable LLVM-based compiler supported
co-design flow from high-level language programs down to FPGA/ASIC
synthesizable processor RTL (VHDL and Verilog generation supported) and
instruction-parallel program binaries.

The size and quantity of register files, function units, supported operations,
and the interconnection network can be freely customized to create new
co-processors ranging from small single-application specific cores with
special operations to more general multi-issue domain-specific processors.

Notable Changes
===============

This release adds support for LLVM 11, initial support for 64b
processor designs, a new instruction scheduler which can utilize the
TTA specialities more efficiently, speeds up the compiler retargeting
by over 3x and fixes a bunch of bugs.
